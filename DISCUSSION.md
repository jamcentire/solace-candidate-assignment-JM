Future improvements:

1. Change the type of phone number in the database to string - there is no use case that I can think of where we need to use it as a number, and it will make it easier to operate on.
2. Add the ability to sort our results based on the field value. This is specifically useful for targetting years of experience, although can also be useful for alphabetizing city/name/etc.
